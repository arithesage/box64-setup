# [WIP] Box64 Setup

Here you have what is usually needed to add support to an ARM64 system
for running x86\_64 (64 bit) executables.

Keep in mind that, in order for running a x86\_64 binary, you need to install
its dependencies, but for arm64 architecture, instead of the amd64 ones.

Because that, you have to install the package manually (because, if you use
'apt install' method, APT will install the amd64 dependencies instead of
the arm64 ones).
